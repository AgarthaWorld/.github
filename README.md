# AgarthaWorld

AgarthaWorld is an independent game studio focused on building a single, deep and persistent Minecraft experience.

Our flagship project is **Agartha** — a large-scale Earth-based civilization server designed around territory, economy, politics and long-term progression.

We do not build multiple game modes.  
We build **one world**, and we build it exceptionally well.

## What is Agartha?

Agartha is not a seasonal server.  
It is not a collection of mini-games.

It is a **persistent simulation of civilization on a real-world Earth map**, where player decisions shape the economy, borders, alliances and history of the world over months and years.

Everything in Agartha is designed for longevity:

- No forced resets  
- No pay-to-win mechanics  
- No shallow progression loops  

---

## Design Philosophy

- One mode, maximum depth  
- Persistence over resets  
- Systems over gimmicks  
- Player-driven history  
- Fair monetization  
- Technical excellence as a feature  

---

## Technical Vision

Agartha is built with production-grade engineering principles:

- Folia-first architecture  
- Modular, domain-driven plugins  
- Clear separation between UI, domain logic and persistence  
- Vanilla-rich UI (no resource packs required)  
- Event-driven systems  
- Designed for horizontal scalability  

Each repository in this organization represents a **bounded context** with a clear responsibility.

## Repository Structure

Typical repositories include:

- agartha-platform — shared bootstrap and infrastructure  
- agartha-api — stable contracts and domain events  
- agartha-domain — core game rules and validations  
- agartha-data — persistence and migrations  
- agartha-ui — vanilla UI framework and menus  
- agartha-claims — territorial control system  
- agartha-towns — city management and social structure  
- agartha-economy — economic engine  

---

## Our Goal

To create a living world where:

- Territory matters  
- Economy is meaningful  
- Politics are player-driven  
- Progression lasts for years  

AgarthaWorld exists to prove that Minecraft servers can be built as **long-term products**, not disposable seasons.

## Status

This organization contains active development repositories.  
Public documentation and community access will expand as the project approaches release.

---

**Agartha is not just a server.**  
**It is a world.**
